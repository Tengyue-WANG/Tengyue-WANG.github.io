Organic room-temperature phosphorescence (RTP) and afterglow materials show great potential for applications in anti-counterfeiting, data encryption, and bioimaging. Among these, the organic long persistent luminescence (OLPL) materials have attracted considerable attention over the past decades. Herein, we present a three-component system with intriguing photophysical mechanism to achieve bright OLPL materials. Difluoroboron β-diketonate (BF2bdk) molecules with intramolecular charge-transfer (ICT) character were employed as luminescent dopants. An electron donor, N,N,N’,N’-tetramethylbenzidine (TMB), is introduced as a hole-trapping agent, facilitating charge separation and enabling hour-long OLPL emission. Through systematic screening of organic matrices, phenyl 4-methoxybenzoate (MeOPhB) was identified as the optimal matrix to prepare OLPL materials. The resulting BF2bdk-MeOPhB-TMB systems achieve bright and long-lasting afterglow emission lasting up to 2.5 h under ambient conditions, comparable to the performance of inorganic Sr2Al14O25/Eu2+, Dy3+ materials. This offers a versatile framework for extending the design principles of OLPL systems, greatly enriching the repertoire of OLPL materials. Moreover, the aqueous dispersion of this three-component system retains its long-lived afterglow properties, further demonstrating its potential for applications in bioimaging.
