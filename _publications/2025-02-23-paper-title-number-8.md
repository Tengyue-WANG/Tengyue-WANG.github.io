As an emerging environmentally friendly material, the biggest advantage of wood-based materials lies in its renewability and green sustainability, which helps reduce the ecological impact on the environment. There have been some studies on room-temperature phosphorescent wood-based materials nowadays, but no one has explored them in the field of organic long persistent luminescence (OLPL). Here, we report the high-performance organic afterglow observed in the pyrylium salt (Pyr) induced photopolymerization system, and combine it with transparent wood to prepare unprecedented OLPL materials with emission maxima at approximately 596 nm and lasting for more than 1 h. The transparent wood matrix can provide a rigid environment for the Pyr system and act as an oxygen barrier, inhibiting non-radiative decay and oxygen quenching. At the same time, the transparent wood also has good transparency and other characteristics, which can be considered one of the most promising alternative materials in the future. We have also prepared OLPL wood coatings, adhesives, and wood-plastic composites. The combination of various wood-based materials and luminescent technology not only enhances aesthetics and practicality of wood products, but also promotes technological innovation and development in the fields of anti-counterfeiting and data encryption, green building materials, and emergency lighting.
