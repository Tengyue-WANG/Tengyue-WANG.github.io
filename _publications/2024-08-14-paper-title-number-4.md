The long-emission-lifetime nature of room-temperature phosphorescence (RTP) materials lays the foundation of their applications in diverse areas. Despite the advantage of mechanical property, processability and solvent dispersity, the emission lifetimes of polymer-based room-temperature phosphorescence materials remain not particularly long because of the labile nature of organic triplet excited states under ambient conditions. Specifically, ambient phosphorescence lifetime (τP) longer than 2 s and even 4 s have rarely been reported in polymer systems. Here, luminescent compounds with small phosphorescence rate on the order of approximately 10−1 s−1 are designed, ethylene-vinyl alcohol copolymer (EVOH) as polymer matrix and antioxidant 1010 to protect organic triplets are employed, and ultralong phosphorescence lifetime up to 4.6 s under ambient conditions by short-term and low-power excitation are achieved. The resultant materials exhibit high afterglow brightness, long afterglow duration, excellent processability into large area thin films, high transparency and thermal stability, which display promising anticounterfeiting and data encryption functions.
