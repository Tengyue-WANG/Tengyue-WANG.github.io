# About Me

I am Tengyue Wang, currently working as a research assistant at the [Shang Lab](https://www.westlake.edu.cn/faculty/Rui-Shang.shtml) at [Westlake University](https://www.westlake.edu.cn/).

I received my Master's degree in Chemistry in 2025 from the [Zhang Lab](https://www.x-mol.com/groups/zhangkaka) at the [Shanghai Institute of Organic Chemistry](http://www.sioc.ac.cn/).

## Research Focus

My research focuses on **organic semiconductor materials** and **polymer semiconductor materials**. I have investigated the synthesis and spectroscopic properties of these optoelectronic materials.

My future work will center on the **iron-catalyzed synthesis of organic optoelectronic materials**, aiming to improve existing synthetic methods, develop novel organic functional materials, and explore their potential applications in organic electronic devices such as **solar cells, light-emitting diodes, sensors, and flexible wearable electronics**.
